# CREDIT-CARD-DEFAULT-ANALYSIS

• In this study, our focus is on comprehensively understanding credit card client defaults in Taiwan, with a specific emphasis on the efficacy of McNemar's test in predicting the likelihood of these defaults. 

• The central goal is to rigorously assess the accuracy of McNemar's test in estimating the probability of default among customers within a context defined by a multivariate dataset. 

• This dataset, tailored for classification tasks in the business domain, encompasses 30,000 instances characterized by a diverse mix of integer and real-type features. What sets this research apart is its innovative approach to risk management, wherein McNemar's test takes center stage as the exclusive analytical tool. 

• Unlike conventional methods that categorize clients as either credible or not, this study deliberately avoids incorporating other data mining techniques, underscoring the unique reliance on McNemar's test. 

• This statistical method is strategically employed to estimate the actual probability of default, presenting a nuanced and accurate portrayal of credit risk. 

• The study concludes that, within its research scope, McNemar's test stands out as an effective method, offering valuable insights for risk management in the financial sector without the need for additional data mining techniques or linear regression analysis.

FUTURE SCOPE AND IMPROVEMENTS

To improve upon the current approach we can:

• Extend the analysis over a more extended period to identify trends and patterns in credit card default payments. This could involve considering economic cycles,
policy changes, or shifts in consumer behavior over time.

• Explore the development of predictive models that can forecast potential credit card defaults. Machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression or
decision trees, may provide valuable insights into predicting default risk.

• Conduct a detailed segmentation analysis to understand the credit behavior of different customer groups. This can help in tailoring financial products and risk
management strategies based on specific customer characteristics.

• Integrate economic indicators and market trends into the analysis to assess their impact on credit default rates. Economic variables like unemployment rates,
inflation, and GDP growth can significantly influence default patterns.

By implementing these future scope and improvements, credit card default payment analyses can become more sophisticated, accurate, and reflective of real-world
dynamics, ultimately contributing to more effective risk management and financial decision-making.
